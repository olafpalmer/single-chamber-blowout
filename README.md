# single-chamber-blowout
This code is the first implementation of the solution for the single chamber rapid decompression problem, described in the article: "Gasdynamics of rapid and explosive decompressions of pressurized aircraft including active venting" by Alfonso Paganiï€ª and Erasmo Carrera

OBS: IMPORTANT! 
The Equation (2) in the article should be Pi*/Pj = ((gamma + 1)/2)^(gamma/(gamma - 1)) instead of Pi*/Pj = ((gamma + 1)/gamma)^(gamma/(gamma - 1))
Although this mistake in the article, the calculations presented in it seem to have used the right equation.
